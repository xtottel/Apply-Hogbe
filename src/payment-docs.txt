Online Checkout
Last updated July 9th, 2025

Overview
The Online Checkout API allows merchants to accept online payment for goods and services using:

Mobile Money
Bank Card
Wallet (Hubtel, G-Money, Zeepay)
GhQR
Cash / Cheque

Online Checkout


This API offers user-friendly RESTful endpoints that seamlessly integrate online payments into any application.

You may implement the Hubtel Online Checkout to:

Redirect to the Hubtel Website to take payment - Redirect Checkout
Take payment on your own website - Onsite Checkout

Redirect Checkout - How it Works
A customer arrives on your website and clicks on a pay button.
The customer is redirected to the Hubtel checkout page.
The customer selects how they wish to pay.
The customer verifies their identity by inputting their mobile number to receive an OTP or scanning a QR Code with their Hubtel app.
The customer proceeds to choose their preferred payment option.
When payment is completed, a success or failure notification is presented to the customer.
The customer is finally redirected back to your website via your return URL.

Your website loads up the Hubtel Payment page within your website preferably in an iframe.
The customer selects how they wish to make payment.
The customer verifies their identity by entering their mobile number to receive an OTP or scanning a QR Code with their Hubtel app.
The customer proceeds to choose their preferred payment option.
When payment is completed, a success or failure notification is presented to the customer.

Step by Step

Your app makes an HTTP POST request to the Online Checkout API to create an invoice.
Your app receives a response with a checkoutDirectUrl.
Your app then loads the checkoutDirectUrl within your website in an iframe.
After payment is fulfilled, A Callback is sent to your callbackUrl and your returnUrl is loaded.
Your app then makes a request to check and confirm the status of the payment if required.
The checkout invoice has three (3) statuses: pending, completed and cancelled.

Note
In instances where a merchant does not receive the final status of the transaction after five (5) minutes from Hubtel, it is mandatory to perform a status check using the Transaction Status Check API to determine the final status of the transaction.

Transaction Status Check
It is mandatory to implement the Transaction Status Check API as it allows merchants to check for the status of a transaction in rare instances where a merchant does not receive the final status of the transaction from Hubtel after five (5) minutes.

To check the status of a transaction, send an HTTP GET request to the below URL, with either one or more unique transaction identifiers as parameters.

It is also mandatory to parse your POS Sales ID for Status Check requests in the endpoint. Find your POS Sales ID here.

Note
Only requests from whitelisted IP(s) can reach the endpoint. Requests from IP addresses that have not been whitelisted will return a 403 Forbidden error response or a timeout. Submit your public IP(s) to your Retail Systems Engineer to be whitelisted.

We permit a maximum of 4 IP addresses per service.
